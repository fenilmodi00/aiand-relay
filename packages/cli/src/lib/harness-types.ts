/**
 * The two harness families (#8). The single `Harness.run` signature used to
 * hide two architecturally different shapes behind one interface:
 *
 * - **ProxiedHarness** - Claude, Codex. `run` spawns a daemon-backed proxy: it
 *   registers a session, starts a keepalive, proxies /v1/* traffic through the
 *   daemon's ai& client, tracks cost via a CostTracker, and deregisters
 *   on exit. The lifecycle lives in `runProxiedSession` (proxied-session.ts).
 *
 * - **SpawnedHarness** - OpenCode, Pi, Prime, Hermes. `run` spawns the agent
 *   binary directly; the binary's own provider plugin talks to ai& (OpenCode)
 *   or reads injected config from disk (Pi / Prime models.json, Hermes
 *   config.yaml). No daemon, no proxy, no CostTracker, no keepalive.
 *
 * Recording this split in the type system (and in CONTEXT.md) stops the
 * abstraction from hiding two architectures as one. The orphan "codex-app"
 * agent id the daemon knows about (absent from HarnessId) is surfaced for
 * future reconciliation.
